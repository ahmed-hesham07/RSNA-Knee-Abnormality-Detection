# RSNA Knee Abnormality Detection

*Create a model that can detect knee abnormalities based on multimodal imaging data*

**Started:** 12 days ago
**Close:** 2 months to go
**Merger & Entry**

## Overview

A single knee scan can reveal a dozen different problems. In this competition, you are tasked to build machine learning models that detect a defined set of clinically important abnormalities on knee MRI examinations.

## Description

The knee is the most commonly injured and imaged joint in the body. Osteoarthritis alone affects an estimated 654 million people worldwide, while acute knee injuries account for 15 to 40 percent of all sports-related trauma. MRIs show clinicians ligaments, cartilage, menisci, and bone in detail, without exposing patients to radiation.

Reading those scans isn't always straightforward. ACL and MCL tears, meniscal damage, cartilage loss, fractures, and other abnormalities can be subtle, and radiologists don't always interpret them the same way. Access to musculoskeletal radiologists is also limited, especially outside major medical centers, leading to delays and inconsistent diagnoses.

In this competition, you will develop multimodal machine learning models to detect twelve clinically important knee abnormalities. You'll work with the first RSNA AI Challenge dataset that pairs every imaging study with its original radiology report, enabling your models to learn from both visual scans and written diagnostic text.

High-performing models can act as robust decision support tools, delivering the accuracy, consistency, and speed needed to elevate expert-level knee MRI interpretation and improve care across disparate clinic settings.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated by the average area under the ROC curve between the predicted confidence scores and the observed targets across the twelve targets:

$$\text{Final Score} = \frac{1}{12}\sum_{i=0}^{11} AUC_i$$

The final score is, in other words, the macro-averaged AUC ROC.

## Submission File

For each row in the test set, you must predict a confidence score for each of the twelve target labels. The file should contain a header and have the following format:

```
StudyInstanceUID,ACL,MCL,Medial Meniscus,Lateral Meniscus,Medial OA,Lateral OA,PF OA,Effusion,Synovitis,Baker's,Contusion,Fracture
<uid_1>,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
<uid_2>,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5
...
```

Because this competition is being hosted in coordination with the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Annual Meeting, winners will be invited and strongly encouraged to attend the AI Challenge Recognition Event with waived fee, contingent on review of solution and fulfillment of winners' obligations.

Note that, per the competition rules, in addition to the standard Kaggle Winners' Obligations (open-source licensing requirements, solution packaging/delivery, presentation to host), the host team also asks that you:

(i) create a short video presenting your approach and solution, and

(ii) publish a link to your open sourced code and the weights on the competition forum

(iii) Share final version of model as publicly available for open distribution and validation. Please see https://www.kaggle.com/models/tom99763/9th-place-models-rsna-iad/PyTorch/default as an example.

## Code Requirements

Submissions to this competition must be made through Notebooks. In order for the "Submit" button to be active after a commit, the following conditions must be met:

- CPU Notebook <= 9 hours run-time
- GPU Notebook <= 9 hours run-time
- Internet access disabled
- Freely & publicly available external data is allowed, including pre-trained models
- Submission file must be named submission.csv

Please see the Code Competition FAQ for more information on how to submit. And review the code debugging doc if you are encountering submission errors.

## Efficiency Prize Evaluation

### Efficiency Prize

We are hosting a second track that focuses on model efficiency, because highly accurate models are often computationally heavy.

For the Efficiency Prize, we will evaluate submissions on both runtime and predictive performance.

To be eligible for an Efficiency Prize, a submission:

- Must be among the submissions selected by a team for the Leaderboard Prize, or else among those submissions automatically selected under the conditions described in the My Submissions tab.
- Must be ranked on the Private Leaderboard higher than the sample_submission.csv benchmark.

All submissions meeting these conditions will be considered for the Efficiency Prize. A submission may be eligible for both the Leaderboard Prize and the Efficiency Prize.

An Efficiency Prize will be awarded to eligible submissions according to how they are ranked by the following evaluation metric on the private test data. See the Prizes tab for the prize awarded to each rank. More details may be posted via discussion forum updates.

### Efficiency Score

We compute a submission's efficiency score by:

$$\text{Efficiency} = \frac{ \text{AUC} }{ \text{Benchmark} - \max\text{AUC} } + \frac{ \text{RuntimeSeconds} }{ 32400 }$$

where AUC is the submission's score on the main competition metric, Benchmark is the score of the benchmark sample_submission.csv, max AUC is the maximum AUC of all submissions on the Private Leaderboard, and RuntimeSeconds is the number of seconds it takes for the submission to be evaluated. The objective is to minimize the efficiency score.

During the training period of the competition, you may see a leaderboard for the public test data in the following notebook, updated daily: Efficiency Leaderboard. After the competition ends, we will update this leaderboard with efficiency scores on the private data. During the training period, this leaderboard will show only the rank of each team, but not the complete score.

# Dataset Description

This dataset contains knee MRI studies annotated for twelve common findings: ligament and meniscus injuries, three compartments of osteoarthritis, joint effusion, synovitis, Baker's cyst, bone contusion, and fracture. Each study comprises a collection of individual MRI sequences from a single scanning session formatted as DICOM series. Your task is to predict the per-study probability of each of the twelve findings.

Studies come from a diverse international mix of imaging sites and span a wide range of scanners, protocols, and populations. Only a small subset of training studies carry per-condition labels. We also provide the original text of the radiology report from which you may wish to derive the labels for the remaining studies.

## Files

### train.csv

One row per training study.

- **StudyInstanceUID** - unique identifier for the study; matches the folder name under train_series/.
- **Report** - the free-text radiology report. May be in any of several languages, depending on the reporting institution.
- Twelve binary labels:
  - **ACL** - anterior cruciate ligament injury (0/1).
  - **MCL** - medial collateral ligament injury (0/1).
  - **Medial Meniscus** - medial meniscus tear (0/1).
  - **Lateral Meniscus** - lateral meniscus tear (0/1).
  - **Medial OA** - osteoarthritis of the medial tibiofemoral compartment (0/1).
  - **Lateral OA** - osteoarthritis of the lateral tibiofemoral compartment (0/1).
  - **PF OA** - patellofemoral osteoarthritis (0/1).
  - **Effusion** - joint effusion / excess fluid (0/1).
  - **Synovitis** - inflammation of the joint lining (0/1).
  - **Baker's** - Baker's cyst (0/1).
  - **Contusion** - bone contusion / bone bruise (0/1).
  - **Fracture** - fracture (0/1).

### train_series.csv

One row per training series. Each series is a single MRI acquisition and each study comprises several series.

- **StudyInstanceUID** - study this series belongs to.
- **SeriesInstanceUID** - unique identifier for the series; matches the folder name under train_series/<StudyInstanceUID>/.
- **Fluid_Sensitive** - 1 if the sequence emphasizes fluid signal (T2, PD, STIR, and similar), 0 otherwise.
- **Fat_Suppression** - 1 if the sequence applies fat suppression, 0 otherwise. Note that although Fluid_Sensitive and Fat_Suppression are often correlated, as observed in the training set, they are not necessarily equivalent for every case.
- **Anatomical_Plane** - imaging plane: Sagittal, Coronal, or Axial.

### train_series/

Training DICOMs, organized as `train_series/<StudyInstanceUID>/<SeriesInstanceUID>/<SOPInstanceUID>.dcm`. Each .dcm is a single image slice. Series typically contain 20–45 slices (median 30), with a long tail out to a few hundred.

### test.csv

Example test file with three study IDs from the public test set. During scoring, this example data will be replaced with the actual test data. There are about 1300 studies in the test set. The Report field will not be provided at the testing stage.

- **StudyInstanceUID** - unique identifier for a test study.

### test_series.csv

Same schema as train_series.csv, for the example test studies. Replaced with the real test-series descriptors during scoring.

### test_series/

Example test DICOMs, same layout as train_series/. Replaced with the real test DICOMs during scoring.

### sample_submission.csv

A valid submission with all label columns set to 0.5.

## Dataset Distribution Notice

Although efforts have been made to ensure each abnormality is represented in each dataset, the prevalence of abnormalities is not guaranteed to be the same across the training, public leaderboard, and final evaluation datasets.

## DICOM Notes

Intensities, orientations, and resolutions vary across series and studies. Series come in a mix of transfer syntaxes (uncompressed Explicit VR Little Endian, JPEG Lossless, JPEG 2000, Implicit VR Little Endian). Every DICOM has been stripped to an allowlisted set of 86 metadata tags.

You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor's specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner's Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced. After your solution has been validated, you may be asked to discuss your results via a recorded call or panel call with the competition sponsors, which call may take the form of a panel with the attendance of other winners.

**6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS**

a. You may use data other than the Competition Data ("External Data") to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).

b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., "geo restrictions") associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be "reasonably accessible to all" and of "minimal cost". Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):

Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a "Reasonableness" standard (the "Reasonableness Standard"). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.

By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.

c. Automated Machine Learning Tools ("AMLT")

Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) ("AMLT") (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.

**7. ELIGIBILITY**

a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.

**8. WINNER'S OBLIGATIONS**

a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:

Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code, including model weights, as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow these documentation guidelines, must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, model weights, and a description of the required computational environment. The computational environment can take the form of a pip requirements.txt with one of: 1) the corresponding kaggle image or a 2) a dockerfile used to build the image. The model weights should be provided as a public kaggle dataset so it is both publicly accessible and linked to the inference/submission code. For Hackathons, the Submission deliverables will be as described on the Competition Website, which may be information or materials that are not software code.

a. To the extent that the final model's software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner's Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).

b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner's Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,

Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;

Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).

**9. GOVERNING LAW**

a. Unless otherwise provided in the Competition Specific Rules above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Rules will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the Federal or State courts of DuPage County, Illinois, USA. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. If any provision of these Rules is held to be invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions of the Rules will remain in full force and effect.
